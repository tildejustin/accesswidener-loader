## AccessWidener Loader

Remaps and loads any number of accesswideners from the `.minecraft/config/accesswideners` folder.

note: it can only remap from the mappings minecraft is using. with fabric loader 0.15 and mapping io support, we can now use tiny v2 and thus merged mappings at runtime
with `official`, `intermediary`, and `named` mappings all at once. an example on how to do this for legacy fabric 1.3.2 with prism launcher patches is provided below, but a
warning: if you don't know what any of this means, this mod probably isn't applicable to you.
